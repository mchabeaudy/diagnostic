# Welcome to our Awesome Medical Application! 🚀

Welcome to the repository for our amazing Medical Application! 🏥 This application helps you manage patients, medical units, and match patients with the appropriate medical units. It's not just a medical application; it's a journey towards better health and wellness! 💪

## How to Build and Deploy

To build the application, simply run the following command:

```
./gradlew clean build
```

## MedicalUnit API

With the MedicalUnit API, you can keep track of medical units with ease. Whether it's a hospital, clinic, or health center, our API has got you covered. Because when it comes to health care, every unit counts! 🏥

## MatchPatient API
